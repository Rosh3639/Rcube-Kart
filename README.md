# Rcube-Kart
Basically it is an e-commerce shopping website such as amazon, flip-kart etc. I learnt many new things in this such as how logic works behind in such websites. Too be honest it was an amazing experience. I learnt how various technologies can be used at once while building such tough website. Also I learnt how users data is being stored safely and to make our website safely encrypted/protected from various attackers. Also I learnt payment gateway which was the first time I learnt about this conecpt but I didn't implemented in this.  It really boosted my confidence and the main thing is I learnt alot!!

Technologies I used in this project are:
Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jquery
